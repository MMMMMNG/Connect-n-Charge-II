## Workflow rules

Maintaining a clean repository is essential for the success of any project. One of the key elements to achieve this is
to handle every task in a separate branch that originates from the development branch. Once the task is completed, the
branch should be submitted as a pull request, and the team manager should conduct a code review. If no issues are found,
the pull request can be merged into the development branch. It's important to note that the main branch is reserved
exclusively for releases. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your project stays organized, efficient,
and error-free.

## Getting started

```
git clone https://gitlab.fhnw.ch/ip12-22vt/ip12-22vt_ladestationen/ip12-connectncharge.git
